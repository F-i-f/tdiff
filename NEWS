* Release 0.7
** April 26, 2019.

** New features:

- Bash and Zsh completion functions are now included.

- A manual page is now included.

- New -W --always-exec-diff option.

** User-visible changes:

- The (unimplemented) option -e / --hardlinks has been (temporarily)
  removed.

- When reporting mode discrepancies (-m / --mode), if no mask is used
  with --mode-or or --mode-and, then masked values are not shown.

- The -| / --mode-or and -&amp; / --mode-and options now take their
  arguments as octal (no need to lead them with a zero to force octal
  parsing).

- The -p / --no-mmap option has been removed.

- Using the -v / --verbose option more than once now increases the
  logging level.

- The -V / --version option now prints compiled in features (ACLs,
  xattrs, etc.)

- The command specified in -w / --exec-always is not run anymore if
  both files to be compared are hard-links of each other.

- Updated BSD / MacOSX flags.

** Bugs fixed:

- Fixed bug where paths could be wrongly displayed (when one of the
  arguments was / or ../ for example).

- Change the inode cache hash function to DJB2 (performance).

- Times could sometimes be compared incorrectly.

- Compare symbolic links contents only when requested.

- Crash fixed when the command line for -x / --exec or -w /
  --exec-always did not reference both %1 and %2.

** Internal changes

- Move to Git, git-aware build scripts.

- Open files with O_NOATIME.

- Factorize some autoconf code into macros.

- Fix build errors when cross-compiling.

- Support getdents64 on Linux.

- Portability fixes for FreeBSD 12, MacOSX, Android, Solaris.

- Add test suite.

- Include RPM spec file.
