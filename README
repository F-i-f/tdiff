Tdiff is a tool to compare filesystem trees.

Compared to diff -r, tdiff is able to report on discrepancies in file
ownership, modes, acls, extended attributes, block size usage and
pretty much any other inode attribute you can think of.

Tdiff is also hard-link aware and will skip comparing file pairs which
it has already seen (in case of hard links or bind mounts).
